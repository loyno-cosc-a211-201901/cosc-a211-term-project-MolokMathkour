# A-initial-files-with-description

The first step I suggest is for you to create an empty C++ file.

Please begin the file name with your last name, but you can name it whatever you like after that.

Don't include spaces in the file name.  It will cause you a big pain in the neck.

Now, add in your `#include` and `using namespace` etc and create an empty `main` function.

In comments, write a description of what you want your program to do.

## What should I describe? How?

Just write a narrative including the following sorts of things:

* what you want your program to do:
  I want my program to create a list of the user’s inputs and be able to delete any task in the list that had been done
  I want my program to be able to help the user organize the important to-do-list for trip or travel and be able to organize it in files by similarities.

* The sequence of actions your user will take:
First: The user has to create the list by entering the trip information like how many days the user want to stay, tickets, to-do-list

* What you expect the results to be:
I expect the result to show a list of the user’s input that allowed the use to see all their important items in a list
I also want the program to be able to let the use delete the completed task from the list

* What you want the program user to see:
the list and be able to modify it

* What calculations or logic do you want the program to do:
to calculate the approximate budget depending on the user’s
For example, if the user want to get tickets and the user set the ticket’s budget to be 200 dollars and the hotel to be 1000, the user used $1,200 to finish these task. However, if the user set the budget to be 1,000 from the beginning then the program will prompt the user that the budget has been increased.

* Are you reading or using files?
I want to use it  but I am not sure how this is going to make my program better
* Are you writing information to files?
I want to use it but I am not sure how this is going to make my program better

## Compile the file
Yes, the file doesn't do anything, but that is actually still OK.

## Create a pull request to branch "A-initial-files-with-description" for feedback
**OPTIONAL**
You do not have to do this, but it could be a useful milestone for you, and allows me the opportunity to give you feedback when I can
